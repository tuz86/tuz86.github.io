Alex Tulloch (OSCP)

I am an aspiring junior pentester with a love for all things tech. 

Having used other peoples writeups on my OSCP journy I thought it was about time I started putting together some of my writeups as a resource, to keep track of my progress and impove my report writing skills.

Thanks to the great community for creating the boxes and all the indiviuals giving nudges in the right direction to anyone trying to learn.

Always happy to help if I can.
